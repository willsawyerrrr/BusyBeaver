The Turing Machine in example 1 has the following states:
  State       Represents
    q0          the initial state
    saw_#       exactly one '#' character has been read
    saw_##      exactly two consecutive '#' characters have been read
    qa          the accept state
    qr          the reject state


The Turing Machine in example 2 has the following states:
  State               Represents
    q0                  
    Check0              
    Check1              
    End                 
    FindDelimeter0      
    FindDelimeter1      
    FindLeftmost        
    FindNext            
    Check0              
    Check1                  
    qa                  
    qr
