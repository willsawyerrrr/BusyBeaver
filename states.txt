The Turing Machine in example 1 has the following states:
  State       Represents
    q0          the initial state
    saw_#       exactly one '#' character has been read
    saw_##      exactly two consecutive '#' characters have been read
    qa          the accept state
    qr          the reject state


The Turing Machine in example 2 has the following states:
  State               Represents
    q0                  the initial state
    Check0              searching for '0'
    Check1              searching for '1'
    End                 ready to end on empty string
    FindDelimeter0      searching for '#'
    FindDelimeter1      searching for '#'
    FindLeftmost        returning to beginning of input string
    FindNext            begins loop again
    qa                  the accept state
    qr                  the reject state
