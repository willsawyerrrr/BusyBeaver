Turing Machines, by definition, are able to run infinitely. As such, being able
to control the execution of a TM simulation allows us to more reasonably manage
its operation and prevent it from draining resources infinitely - or as
infinitely as plausible for a simulation.

Using Python generators allows us to gain this extra control over the Turing
Machine simulation by yielding results at each transition of the machine. We
also benefit from being able to print configuration information to see how the
Machine is behaving from a human-readable perspective.
